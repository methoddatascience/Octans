Executive Summary:

The Disc Regeneration Project ended on 31 October 2012. Over its four year research period, all project deliverables and objectives had been achieved. Furthermore, this was a project whose combined energy, creativity and expertise has generated a wealth of knowledge and insights ripe for exploitation. This is a seminal project, destined to make a significant impact in IVD therapeutic and clinical practice and its contiguous areas, where researchers seek to employ tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies similar to those devised and adopted in this interdisciplinary study.

The overall objective of the Disc Regeneration Project was to provide a cure for lower back pain by developing porous scaffolds and technology which will repair a damaged intervertebral disc (IVD) by enabling its regeneration to a natural healthy state or better. Injectable acellular and cell-loaded bioactive polymer-based scaffolds were developed. A biomimetic approach conferred the appropriate mechanical and biological properties and enabled the inclusion of the requisite cell signalling factors, to produce a biohybrid structure which closely resembled human tissue in all its essential attributes. For this purpose, cell-loaded and acellular injectable gels have been prepared for nucleus substitutes as well as a custom made scaffolds for IVD based of the inputs from an imaging technique and modeling of the natural IVD. In intervertebral disc tissue, vascularization must be carefully controlled, due to the unique anatomy and physiology of the IVD, with negligible vascularization in the annulus and nucleus regions and moderate vascularisation at the vertebral body level. This was successfully achieved by functionalizing by hyperbranched peptides able to block the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or by functionalizing materials loaded with stem cells able to secrete soluble VEGF receptors also resulting in the blocking of the growth factor activity. Great effort was devoted to definition of a minimal invasive surgery technique by considering the patient’s safety and health-care costs.

The clinical solution offered by this project will address the most significant medical condition worldwide, namely back pain. Work-related low back disorders, covering both low back pain and low back injuries, are a significant and increasing problem in Europe. Although very common across all types of industries and jobs, several studies have demonstrated that low back disorder rates are particularly prevalent in certain types of industries and within certain occupations. Estimates from EU Member States of the economic costs of all work-related ill health have been estimated to range from 2.6% to 3.8% of GNP. These figures maybe higher, as true social costs are difficult to estimate. It represents the new frontier and one of the strongest market growth opportunity in the medical technology industry. The project will generate innovative science and technical knowledge at international level in the field of spine regeneration and, in general, in regenerative medicine.

The emphasis in biomaterials subsequently shifted from structures which were essentially bioinert, to producing bioactive components capable of eliciting controlled actions and reactions within the body. These materials have been designed so that they could be injected with minimal invasive surgery to induce in situ treatments such as the regeneration of the main intevertebral disc compartments. Development of novel cell culture techniques, synthesis and design of bioresorbable polymers and composites, and tissue engineering strategies have recently emerged as the most advanced therapeutic option presently available in regenerative medicine. There is great potential also for angiogenesis control systems developed for the Disc Regeneration project in areas such as the treatment of articular cartilage degeneration, advanced macular degeneration (which increases rapidly with longevity) and vein thrombosis.

Project Context and Objectives:

2. Summary Description of Project Context and Objectives

2.1 Project Context

The DISC REGENERATION PROJECT was conceived in order to solve patients’ morbidity caused by intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, using a Tissue Engineering (TE) approach leading to the regeneration of the different histological compartments of the disc. The clinical solution sought addresses the most significant medical condition worldwide, namely, back pain.

Back pain significantly affects the quality of life and the workforce in industrialized countries, as 80% of people suffer from back pain at some time during their lives. Back pain most frequently occurs between ages 30 and 50, and therefore has enormous economic consequences both on health care spending, absenteeism and productivity loss.

Causes of lower back pain are multifactorial, but in the majority of cases it is linked to clinical evidence of IVD degeneration. As a consequence, curing disc degeneration is one of the most important socioeconomic imperatives facing modern health care. A major factor in our proposing a TE solution to IVD degeneration as a research topic was the absence of any effective current treatment which does not either suffer serious limitations (e.g., spinal fusion) or is unreliable (e.g., prosthetic devices).

The DISC REGENERATION PROJECT sought to realise the concept of producing a TE construct, implanted using minimally invasive surgery (e.g., injection) to induce histologically differentiated in situ regeneration of the main IVD compartments, the nucleous pulposus and the annulus, and their physiological interaction with the surrounding vertebral bodies through temporary end-plate substitutes. Design of materials and biological cues will be tuned to the specific regions of the disc substitute structure to control angiogenesis.

The main objectives of the project were pursued by addressing, in a highly coordinated manner, the specific scientific and technological objectives which are set out below at 2.2.

2.2 Concept and Project Objectives

The concept of the DISC REGENERATION PROJECT was to achieve its overall objectives (a - c, below) through the coordinated pursuit of a set of science and technology objectives (d - h, below).

Overall objectives

(a) Regeneration of a healthy IVD and restoration of a physiological disc-vertebral system through appropriate biomimicking of the anatomy, physiology, cell biology and metabolism of the relative natural structures.

Advances in molecular biology have enabled the adoption of a more rationalized biomimetic tissue engineering approach to this problem where the synergistic action of growth factors, adult notochordal cells, or stem cells is being actively pursued to achieve the regeneration of damaged IVD. Previous works have focused on the replacement, repair or regeneration of the nucleus pulposus only, with little consideration of the annulus scaffold, although the latter also often suffers degeneration. In this project, we sought to rectify this omission and to pursue a comprehensive approach to the regeneration of the disc-vertebral system, addressing the problems related to the degeneration/damage of each of its structural natural components.

The Project Consortium combined the study of the anatomy, physiology, cell biology and metabolism of the natural structures to their biomechanics to restore physiological load distribution, viscoelastic properties and transport properties. The restoration of these parameters was sought by a thorough analysis of a wide variety of highly porous scaffolds, ranging from gel-like to solid polymers and composites. These will be capable of acting as hosts for cells and amenable to decoration or functionalization with the appropriate species required to control angiogenesis (see below).

The scaffolds were designed to be used either as a cell-free implant or following association with progenitor cells.

(b) Development of novel biomaterials capable of controlling angiogenesis such that it can proceed at different extents as required by the different regions of the disc structure.

The required differentiated control of angiogenesis will be sought by the decoration of implanted polymers with three classes of peptides, which are either analogues or antagonists or binders of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The first class of peptides will include amino acid sequences of VEGF, which confers bioactivity by stimulating endothelial cells to sprout into new vessels. The study of the effect of using different peptide concentrations and methods of grafting will lead to a decorated polymer system which will induce a moderate degree of angiogenesis within the implanted material, as required for the external lamella of the annulus.

The second type of peptide was based upon VEGF-inactive analogues, obtained from available peptide combinatorial synthesis libraries. These would be able to block the VEGF receptors present on the endothelial cell membrane, thus terminating the cell’s angiogenic potential. The third class included peptides able to bind and inactivate endogenous VEGF.

The controlled release of these factors upon implantation was optimized through different strategies of reversible grafting to the scaffolds.

In an alternative approach, stem cells previously engineered to produce and secrete soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sFlk-1) was used to locally abrogate VEGF signaling, with the aim of ensuring a sustained, long-term expression of this inhibiting factor.

(c) Enhanced integration of the IVD TE construct with the adjacent vertebral body upon implantation.

This objective was addressed by seeking to prevent the formation of interfacial fibrotic tissue. PDGF-BB peptide antagonists were synthesized and grafted to the scaffolds through reversible chemical bonds. These antagonists can potentially block fibroblast proliferation, so impeding the invasion of the implanted substitutes by these types of cells and the consequent development of fibrotic tissue. Moreover, bioadhesives are developed for immediate functionality of the implant and tissue. The development of bioadhesive biomaterials ensure the immediate and long-term functionality of the implant through improved interactions with different tissues were defects are generated by pathological and/or external stimuli. An in vivo study is implemented to verify the functionality of the final cellular and acellular substitutes and surgical technique.

Science and Technology Objectives

(d) To devise injectable scaffolds

- which are biocompatible, stable with appropriate transport, rheological properties and bioactive properties to induce disc regeneration through the use of defined mechanical, chemical and biological signals.

(e) To develop bioactive scaffolds

- which

(a) are able to support cell viability and differentiation,
(b) are injectable,
(c) are convertible into gel matrices after implantation,
(d) are biocompatible and biodegradable,
(e) could contain adhesive and morphoregulatory immobilised cues within the matrix, and
(f) could deliver growth factors.

(f) To devise a surgical protocol

- to enable the application in vivo of both acellular and cell-loaded substitutes. This was based upon minimally invasive (percutaneous) surgery, and enabled the study of the impact of injection on the materials and cells. Achievement of this objective required the design of a suitable injection device and the identification of potential adhesives and sealant systems.

(g) To achieve in vivo biofunctionality of the nucleus/annulus substitutes and adhesives.

In vivo models are considered for different animal size in consideration of different stage of substitutes developments.

(h) To devise and execute effective assessment of the clinical feasibility of the proposed materials and techniques.

Clinical feasibility is undertaken by simulating sugery techniques on human cadaver models.

1. Injectable bioactive scaffolds

Novel biomaterials to be used alone or cell-combined in the treatmentof degenerated IVD that integrate biological, physico-chemical and mechanical properties mimicking the native IVD. These biomaterials are able to modulate angiogenesis according to the various and specific requirements of different IVD regions.

As reported in the literature, many injectable systems, based on synthetic in situ curing polymers such as acrylates have been investigated for the nucleus replacement or augmentation Even though able to restore disc eight and motion, all of them lack in the restoration of physiological biomechanics of the spine and they present surgical technique limitations as well as limited biocompatibility. To overcome these limitations, injectable hydrogels have been already proposed. In many scientific works several natural and synthetic chemically, or physically crosslinked hydrogel-based materials have been taken into consideration. However, none of the systems reported in the literature seem to mimic the required rheological behavior. Furthermore, the injection through clinical catheters may negatively affect their viscoelastic properties. Accordingly, the optimization of cellular and cell-loaded micro/nano-composite gels and semi-interpenetrating polymer networks has been carried out taking into consideration all the above reported features. Several gels have been deeply analyzed, among these Hyadd3, Ionic crosslinked gellan gum/glycidyl methacrylate, collagen/hyaluronic acid/gelatin microspheres and collagen/hyaluronic acid have demonstrate appropriate biofunctionality.

2. One-piece custom polymeric IVD scaffold

The intervertebral disc (IVD) has a very complex structure as it consists of three different tissues: annulus, nucleus and endplate. The one-piece custom made poly(ε-caprolactone) intervertebral disc (IVD) scaffold have been designed taking into account three different regions (annulus, nucleus and endplates) and manufactured through rapid prototyping technique satring from NMR and or CT imgaing techniques. The inferior and superior endplates are properly designed to avoid the leaking out of ionically crosslinked methacrylated gellan gum (iGG-MA), whilst allowing for the injection of gel or reactive solution into and throughout the fully interconnected pore network of the 3D “morphologically controlled” structure.

3 Cells type and sources.

Due to intrinsic difficulty to recruit IVD cells, different cell type and sources for both differentiated chondrocytes and stem cells with a potential for chondrocyte differentiation have been analysed for cell-loaded nucleus substitutes. The sources of progenitor cells to be investigated were the adipose tissue and the bone marrow tissue, differentiated chondrocyte phenotype such as Articular Cartilage Chondrocytes, Nasal Cartilage Chonrdocytes and Nucleous Cartilage Chondrocytes were included as positive control. The selection was done on the basis of i) Donor availability and ethical feasibility, ii) Culture conditions, iii) Specific medium supplements/cell manipulation, iv) Cell proliferation capacity; v) Cell phenotype plasticity.

The full analysis indicates that bone marrow were used as the source of stem cells while the source of differentiated chondrocytes were the nasal cartilage.

4 Blocking of angiogenesis by using a cell based gene therapy approach

Blocking angiogenesis by over-expressing soluble VEGF receptor-2 (sFlk-1)- by using transduced nasal chondrocyted (NC) or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (BMSC)- efficiently prevents vascular invasion and greatly improves chondrogenesis in vivo by both NC and BMSC.

5 Novel growth factor analogues and antagonists

Application to tissue regeneration of hyperbranched poly(epsilon-lysine) macromolecules (i.e. dendrons) with a molecular root capable of facilitating the interactions with the hydrogel (e.g. gellan gum) polymeric surface and with a linear sequence (WHLPFKC) exposed at the uppermost branching generation that is able to block VEGF activity. The results demonstrated high efficacy interactions with gels (Gellan gum) and appropriate control of angiogenesis in vitro and in a chicken chorioallontoic membrane model CAM. The functionalization of different types of hydrogels was demonstrated with comparable anti-angiogenesis effect.

Top micrograph shows in vitro endothelial cell sprouting in a 3D Matrigel substrate. Middle micrograph shows cell sprouting on the surface of control gellan gum. Bottom micrograph shows regression of sprouting around the surface of gellan gum functionalised with dendronised VEGF blockers.

6 New injection device and surgical technique

The injection device has been developed according to biomaterial properties. It enables the application of the different biomaterials proposed in the project as the nucleus substitute or the sealing materials and systems.

The functional injectability of such materials clearly plays a crucial role. During the injection through a clinical catheter high strains are normally achieved, thus leading to an alteration of the polymeric network especially in the case of materials characterized by a weak structure or micro/nano-composite materials.

Accordingly, the design of a suitable injection device has to take into account the chemical, physical, biological properties as well as the rheological and flow behaviour of the potential nucleus substitutes together with the employed surgical needs.

For this reason, in order to ensure versatility and to adapt the device to a wide range of potential materials, it was decided to design a syringe for two-component materials

The surgical technique has been defined for minimally invasive and open surgery approach. It has been tested on animal and cadaveric specimens.

7 New sealing system

The less invasive nucleus replacement technique, performed with a synthetic material or a tissue-engineered structure, may restore disc height and spine mobility and preserve the annulus while this and endplates are relatively healthy and still functional. In this field, a mounting research effort has been devoted to the design of appropriate techniques and systems to close the annulus defects, thus avoiding the leaking out of the nucleus substitute. Currently, sealant systems employed to close annulus defects would seem to be not effective. Accordingly, the design of a polymeric balloon plug made of polyurathene has been proposed in the project. The largest part of these balloon plugs must be introduced into the defect through an appropriate cannula and then filled with an injectable material that can harden in situ. This system was developed by integrating different techniques such as 3D modelling and dip casting in polyurathene solution, with those related to the preparation of suitable polymer/solvent solutions, mould and wax mandrel preparation, mandrel removal.

8 Models of disc substitutes

Several computational models were developed to study the biomaterial behavior in a physiological healthy and pathological environment. It has been defiened a poromechanical finite element (FE) model of the intervertebral disc (IVD) coupled to a transport model to study the effect of mechanical and nutritional factors on the diffusion of three fundamental cell solutes, i.e. oxygen, lactate and glucose, strongly related with disc cell metabolism (Malandrino et al. 2011 PLoS Comp Biol).

Such model has been further coupled to cell survival within the disc, taking into account the reported dependency of cell death on low levels of pH and glucose.

In particular, the following knowledge has been generated:

(a) Development of a transport model simulating the movement of solutes within a healthy and degenerated disc when submitted to complex loading conditions.
(b) Study of the intervertebral disc cell viability in relation to glucose concentration and pH level when submitted to transient loading conditions.
(c) Determination of the most important design functional parameters for a new disc implant substitute.
(d) Simulation of the effect of nucleus pulposus disc substitute injection on the compressive capacity of the disc.
(e) Comparison of four methods to simulate swelling in poroelastic finite element models of intervertebral discs.

9 Biomaterial based delivery system for chemoattraction of stem cells

Incorporation of SDF-1 in Ch-based electrostatic complexes formed by layer-by-layer technique to recruit hMSCs. This provides a biomaterial-based delivery system for chemoattraction of stem cells and related scaffolds. Polyelectrolyte complexes have been also designed to deliver anti-inflammatory drug to promote local action of the anti-inflammatory drug, avoiding possible secondary effects of the drug.

The incorporation of Ch/-PGA nanoparticles with the anti-inflammatory drug Df in ionically-crosslinked Gellan gum hydrogels demonstated an homogeneous distribution of the nanoparticles within the gel net without interfering with the gel crosslinking.

The results demonstrate the efficacy of the delivery of an anti-inflammatory drug while suggests the importance of such an approach to control the inflammatory reaction inherent to an implantable biomaterial.

10 Two-component cyanaocrylate and polyurethane based adhesive

Two-component cyanoacrylate based adhesives able to polymerize in less than one second imparting high adhesion. Furthermore, the adhesive is biocompatible, and the exothermal reaction during curing is less pronounced than in commercial cyanoacrylate adhesives for wound closure. In order to improve the mechanical electrospun polyurethane fibers were added to ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECN) adhesive. By adding the polyurethane nano-fiber, the adhesive strength increases noticeably, the highest adhesion is obtained by adding 5 wt% 100S23N fiber, as well as a reductiinon of the exothermal reaction of the ethyl cyanoacrylate was oberved.

Moreover, these adhesives were also functionalised by poly (ε-lysine) dendron which results in a drastically reduction of exothermal reaction of the ethyl cyanoacrylate, too.

A new family of thermoplastic polyurethane adhesives containing natural moieties chemically incorporated into the soft segments to impart high tack. These provide both initial and final adhesion at low cost, and exhibit controlled biodegradability (through the presence of natural moieties in the structure) and high flexibility. Polyurethanes obtained with mixtures of polyadipate of 1,4 butane diol and tung oil in the chain extender were developed. These adhesives demonstrated appopriate performances and stability that could be optimized by the chain extender composition. However, the degradation of the polyurethane sealants is quite moderate assuring that they are stable for sufficient time to maintain their integrity in the disc defect.

11 Collagen microspherese, pH sensitive crosslinker and delivery sytems

Hollow extra-cellular matrix based nanosphere technology designed to allow for higher pay load capacity for the sustained controlled delivery of therapeutic moieties including but not limited to genes, growth factors and peptides to a target site. Hollow spheres of type I collagen were used for the delivery of synthetic gene vectors as polyplexes and showed promising results. Incorporation of polyplexes as synthetic gene vectors within collagen hollow spheres significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of polyplexes, whilst protecting them from degradation without adversely affecting their transfection efficiency.

Moreover, they showed high loading capacity and efficiency, in fact it was possible to load about 20 µg of pDNA per mg of collagen with an efficiency of 85%.

Concurrently, research activities focused on modifying the novel pH-sensitive crosslinker, to incorporate reactive end groups including N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), to facilitate a pH-sensitive sustained release of DNA from collagen sponges.

The stability of pH-sensitive collagen sponges was tested in presence of bacterial collagenase and it was found to be dependent on the ratio of collagen: crosslinker used.

These results correlated with the collagenase assay results confirming that the pH-sensitive polymer can be used as responsive sustained release system.

12 Electrospinning technology for micro-nano scaffolds

The use of electrospinning to create highly porous scaffolds has been investigated. Simultaneous electrospinning of nanofibers and spraying of a hydrogel has been shown to facilitate creation of nanofiber-reinforced hydrogels with high porosity and many possibilities of tuning fiber morphology as well as scaffold assembly. Potential in making injectable functional materials with improved mechanical properties and in tailoring materials properties to facilitate tissue regeneration.

13. Animal model and avanced biomechanical characterization

During the course of the project several animal models have been implemented as function of of the reserach investigaton stage. For screening of in vivo biocompatibility of substitute materials and angiogenic control after ectopic subcutaneous implantation the tests have been performed in rats, rabbits and mice. For biomechanical and histological evaluation of substitute materials in an orthotopic model on sheep. In the sheep model, implants were including cusom made device, gellan gum gels and Hyadd3 gel loaded with BMSCs.

Biomechnaical properties where evaluated with a designed specific mechanical instruments to perform standard flexibility tests. results have been revealed no significant differences in the range of motion between the disc levels, which were implanted with the different hydrogel configurations after nucleotomy and the control levels, which remained unfilled.

14 Design of appropriate packaging

Packaging design takes into account the specific application of HYADD3 hydrogel as cell loaded carrier and Ionic-crosslinked methacrylated gellan gum (iGG-GMA) gel as acellular for one-step surgical approaches.

The requirements for an appropriate packaging have been taken into account in order to guarantee necessary performance, especially considering the use of the material in the surgery room.

The proposed packaging components to meet the requirements are:

1.tray with 5ml syringe with stoppers and end caps
2.paper package insert (instructions for use) or A demo video on hydrogels preparation will be made available.
3.label containing lot number and expiration date.
4.carton box as secondary packaging.

To allow comfortable and controlled injection of the product, a syringe with flange and plunger rod will be used. Moreover, to allow addition of bone marrow derived stem cells via luer adaptor and physical mix through connected syringe, the syringe will be filled up to 3ml.

Scaling-up parameters of both gels have been defined.

Potential Impact

1 Impact - overview

The likely areas of impact of the successful achievement of the Disc Regeneration Project’s objectives will be:

• High socioeconomic impact, due to the high prevalence of back pain and its economic consequences through its effect on the workforce, and the shortcomings of current treatment.
• Meeting the social need for an improved clinical solution to the regeneration of intervertebral disc defects and resultant back pain.
• Enhancing the competitiveness of the European healthcare industry, by

- generating a step change in the treatment of back pain through the invention and development of new materials;
- generation of high added value products in the health sector.

• Implementation of decisive knowledge at the interface of diverse technologies and disciplines, not only to generate a novel application - namely a radical new treatment for back pain – but also to contribute to a strategic platform for further development of TE applications.

This project fitted exactly a key strategic priority area for future European biomedical research, as defined in the EC FP7 Framework Programme. It is highly likely that the Disc Regeneration Project will come to be regarded as a seminal project in this area.

2 Economic and Societal Impact

Low back pain is a major health concern and the most common reported pain among the U.S. adult population [1]. Nearly 50% of the 220 million adults in the United States experience an episode of low back pain each year. For 10% to 15% of these people, the pain becomes chronic (lasting for longer than 6 months). The economic burden of low back pain is enormous. The estimated direct healthcare expenditures on patients with back pain in the United States reached $90 billion [2].

Chronic low back pain can be a complex condition with a multitude of potential sources of the pain.

Diagnosis of the cause of the pain is complicated by the fact that a specific diagnosis can only be made in 20% of cases based upon neurological evaluation and imaging studies alone [3]. Conditions diagnosed through these means include intervertebral stenosis, degenerative disc disease, disc herniation or prolapse, spondylothesis, and vertebral compression fractures, among others.

Traditional treatments of these conditions include laminectomy, discectomy, fusion, and kyphoplasty and represent the core of the $3.8 billion orthopedic spine market [4] For the 80% of patients who cannot be diagnosed through imaging and radiographic studies, other diagnostic procedures must be performed. Researchers have utilized diagnostic nerve blocks and disc provocation studies (discography) to discover that in approximately 40% of these cases, or 4 million patients annually, the back pain is attributable to disruptions of the internal structure within the intervertebral discs [5]. This condition, referred to as discogenic pain, currently has no widely accepted therapy other than surgical spinal fusion.

Work-related low back disorders, covering both low back pain and low back injuries, are a significant and increasing problem in Europe. Although very common across all types of industries and jobs, several studies have demonstrated that low back disorder rates are particularly prevalent in certain types of industries and within certain occupations. In the Netherlands was estimated to be 1.7% of the gross national product. In the UK, 12.5% of all sick days are related to low back disorders, this corresponds with data from Sweden, where 13.5% of sick days are reported. A survey from the HSE estimated 4.8 million working days lost in Britain in 1995 due to back disorders. Calculations have estimated that back disorders cost employers between £315 million and £335 million. The Clinical Standards Advisory Group in the UK estimated the lost production costs to be approximately £3.8 billion and social security benefits £1.4 billion. These figures may be higher, and the true social costs are difficult to estimate.

Whatever the true cost, it is certain that the health, social and economic costs of low back disorders are multiplied by a factors associated with shortcomings in care or awareness. Trade Union Congress reported that only 17% of employers had actually calculated the costs of low back disorders, only a third provided treatment, physiotherapy or rehabilitation and fewer than half monitored the number of workers suffering from and the number of days lost due to low back disorders [6].

Although precise figures do not exist, estimates from EU Member States of the economic costs of all work-related ill health have been estimated to range from 2.6% to 3.8% of Gross National Product.

However, despite the fact that some current technology such as spine fusion is used in Europe and other international market from several years, the introduction of innovative technique and materials based on non-fusion techniques to improve the patient outcome will strongly affect the market growth.

The concept of spine motion preservation is an emerging technology in spine surgery and it is forecast to achieve 16% growth per year. The market opportunity for a successful minimally invasive therapy for discogenic pain could conservatively exceed € 2 billion annually. Spine Surgery, based on spine motion preservation and IVD regeneration, is the new frontier of Orthopaedics & Neurosurgery, and it seems to represent one of the strongest market growth opportunities in the medical technology industry.

The project will also have further long term societal impact - in addition improvements in health and quality of life - through increasing future employment opportunities for the many young scientists, just setting off on their careers, who participated in the Disc Regeneration Project. As conceived as a key feature of this project in the original proposal [7], young scientists were offered an excellent training programme, incorporating numerous visits to other partners’ laboratories and extensive conference participation (vide infra, section 4.2, Main Dissemination Activities ). These young scientists took full advantage of these opportunities. Working together in a highly collaborative environment, they made key contributions to the project’s success and creating the positive and vital atmosphere which defined its activities. This is discussed further in section 4.4 Main Dissemination Activities (vide supra). As intended, the Disc Regeneration Project did indeed offer “an unsurpassed networking opportunity and career platform for young TE scientists” [7].

3 Impact on European Competitiveness

Many experts have recognized that TE and other advanced technologies for the production of "nature-like" structures will, in the next decade and beyond, have a significant impact on medicine and the medical device industry. Not only the European Commission but also the US and Japanese Governments have indicated this to be a area of strategic importance in terms of social, technological and economic impact. The principle has been demonstrated, with the first generation of artificial tissues already approved by both FDA and EC and some products already sold on the market. After some 20 years of painstaking investigation into the processes by which cells grow and differentiate, the nascent field of TE is rapidly maturing, with many start-up companies – predominantly, North American - launching commercial products. Regenerated or lab-grown cartilage, blood vessels, bone and skin as well as embryonic fetal nerve tissue are all being tested in humans, with market forecasts for TE products and processes appearing in the range of €100bn. The present proposal therefore addresses key contemporary issues affecting the competitive position and growth of the European biomedical industry. A further key competitive advantage for Europe gained through this project was the timely leveraging of the EU investments in different related project, not least through stimulating and building a healthy skills base of young TE scientists through networking and research opportunities.

# Neurological Disorders
## Prevalence and treatments
source: [WHO neurological disorders report](http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/neurological_disorders_report_web.pdf) __from 2006__. And wikipedia.

1. Dementia
2. Epilepsy
3. Headache disorders
4. Multiple sclerosis
5. Neuroinfections
6. Narcolepsy
7. Pain associated with neurological disorders
8. Parkinson's disease
9. Stroke
10. Traumatic brain injuries

### 1. Dementia
* 98% occurrence after the age of 65.
* 50-75% of dementia is caused by Alzheimer's disease.
* Only some rare causes can be treated effectively.
  #### Prevalence
Globally 24.3 million people have dementia, 4.6 million new cases per year.
  #### Treatment
No treatment. Progressive decline can only be slowed down in some cases by cholinesterase inhibitors.
Quality of life of patient and caregivers should be main focus

### 2. Epilepsy
* all ages
* abnormal excessive or synchronous neural activity in the brain
* three factors:
  1. Threshold: the ease with which a seizure is provoked. Antiepileptic drugs (AED) increase the threshold.
  2. The abnormality: idiopathic epilepsy is genetic and easily treated. Symptomatic epilepsy is caused by many different disorders, typically harder to treat.
  3. The precipitating condition: flickering light, alcohol or drug removal, fever. Not all patients have identified precipitating conditions.

  #### Prevalence  
4-8 cases per 1000 for active epilepsy (at least one seizure in last five years). 50 million worldwide. Mortality: 1-2 per 100 000 per year.
  #### Treatment
AED treatment can remove seizures in 70% of cases. Selective cases can be effectively and safely treated with surgery.

### 3. Headache disorders
* Many causes, many cases
* Primary:
  1. Migraine
  2. Tension-type headache
  3. Cluster headache
  4. other
* Secondary:
  5. many causes, medication overuse, trauma, infection, cranial disorders, psychiatric.
* Neuralgias and other headaches

  #### Prevalence
All headache disorders: up to 60%.  
Migraine: ~10% of world population. More women than men.  
Tension-type episodic: stress-related. Up to 70% of population in some studies, chronic: 1-3%, mostly women.  
Cluster: max 3 per 1000, 6 men to each woman.  
No mortality associated with headache disorders.
#### Treatment
Migraine: drugs, not always effective. Different drugs work for different people.  
Tension-type: Often treatable with drugs. If not, stress-reduction, physiotherapy, relaxation.  
Cluster headache: often misdiagnosed, no treatment.

### 4. Multiple sclerosis
* Autoimmune disease targeting central nervous system.
* Etiology combination of genetic and environment.
* No known pathogen.
* Lots of research and hopeful scientists.
#### Prevalence
2.5 million people worldwide.
#### Treatment
No cure. Expensive drugs can reduce frequency of attacks.

### 5. Neuroinfections
* 40-70% of AIDS patients have neurological complications.
* Viral encephalitis, many viruses, 70% mortality if not treated.
* Poliomyelitis, almost completely eradicated.
* Rabies, 50 000 deaths per year worldwide.
* Tuberculosis, 9 million new cases in 2004, interacts with HIV, not always only in lungs.
* Leprosy, bacterium, treatable.
* Bacterial meningitis, 4-6 cases per 100 000 per year.
* Tetanus, bacterium, very lethal, immunization = prevention.
* A bunch of parasitic diseases are neurological.

### 6. Narcolepsy
* 70% of patients also have cataplexy, sudden muscle weakness.
* Partly genetic, 10% has family history. partly environmental causes.
#### Prevalence
0.2-600 per 100 000
#### Treatment
No cure. Many different drugs can help different patients.

### 7. Pain associated with neurological disorders
Causes:
* herpes zoster/shingles, caused by chickenpox virus, diabetes mellitus, post-stroke pain, spinal cord disease or damage, tumors, spasticity, muscle rigidity, joint deformities.  

  20% of patients develop depression, increasing the pain.  
  There is a need for more research on chronic pain.

  #### Prevalence
* 8% of stroke patients
* spinal cord injuries: 65%
#### Treatment
Opioids have some efficacy. Topical agents for shingles pain. Electrical stimulation can work but is expensive. Muscle relaxants for spasticity and muscle rigidity causes. Psychological techniques help cope. Physiotherapy.

### 8. Parkinson's  
* motor symptomatology: tremor, posture, speech, swallowing etc.
#### Prevalence
4.5-19 incidence, 72-260 prevalence per 100 000 per year
#### Treatment
All drugs act indirectly through dopaminergic mechanisms. Functional surgery also option.

### 9. Stroke
* Important (third) cause of death after coronary heart disease and cancer.
#### Prevalence
100-600 per 100 000, more in developed countries.
#### Treatment
Restoration of blood supply, thrombolysis. Patients need to know to seek immediate care. Aspirin helps a bit. Sometimes surgery needed, endovascular treatment is usually equally effective.

### 10. Traumatic brain injury
* Half of all trauma deaths
* Prevention is best treatment
#### Prevalence
1-2%% in USA. Incidence 150-300 per 100 000 per year. Mortality per 100 000 population: 15 in Europe, higher in developing world.
#### Treatment
Quick stabilization, fix airway obstruction and falling blood pressure.
